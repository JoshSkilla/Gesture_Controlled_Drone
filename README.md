# Gesture_Controlled_Drone
The goal of this project was to design a drone system capable of being commanded by aircraft marshalling signals through the use of image-processing and deep learning. The system predominantly utilizes OpenCV and PyTorch libraries for real-time detection and classification. 

The image recognition device emulates a virtual controller on a ground control station to send commands to the drone's flight controller via MAVLink.
